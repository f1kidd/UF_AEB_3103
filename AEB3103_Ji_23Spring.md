## Course Description
AEB3103 is a comprehensive economics course designed to give students a strong foundation in economic theory. It is designed to familiarize students with an ``economic way of thinking'' and tools of modern economic analysis *(S)*. These methods and tools will enable students to critically dissect and evaluate economic issues encountered in business, politics, and their everyday lives *(S)*. AEB3103 will cover the microeconomic fundamentals that govern the theory of the consumer; production economics; economic theory of the firm; the functioning and anatomy of markets; agricultural production and policy; the economics of globalization; and international trade *(S)*.

AEB 3103 is an upper-division course and it will be structured and taught accordingly. The rigorous nature of this course and its importance in the curriculum means you should plan on spending on average two hours of studying
outside of class for every hour of lecture time. Thus, given that this is a four-credit course, you should plan on spending about eight additional hours per week studying for AEB3103. During exam weeks, the time-commitment will be significantly higher. A lower study input will more than likely adversely affect your grade.

## Prerequisites
MAC2233 or MAC2311 (or the equivalent). AEB3103 will be taught with the assumption that all students are comfortable with quantitative reasoning, analytical methods, graphs, and algebra. Previous exposure to economics, however, is not necessary. It is recommended that if you are an FRE student, you take this course concurrently with AEB3510 (Quantitative Methods) as the courses together provide a foundation for upper-level study in FRE.

## Expected Student Learning Outcomes:
After the successful completion of AEB 3103, a typical student should be able to: 

**Content**: Identify, describe and explain key themes, principles, and terminology; the history, theory and/or methodologies used; and social institutions, structures, and processes.

* Understand the microeconomic principles and fundamentals underlying consumer behavior (S)
* Classify different market structures and how they influence firm behavior and social welfare (S)
* Describe the effect of globalization and trade on consumers and producers (S)
* Explain sources of market failure and ways to correct them (S)

*Achieved through reading and reflections, class discussions, assignments, and exams*

**Critical Thinking**: Apply formal and informal qualitative or quantitative analysis effectively to examine the processes and means by which individuals make personal and group decisions. Assess and analyze ethical perspectives in individual and societal decisions. 

* Assess economic and social news and events with greater sophistication (S)
* Apply intuitive, graphical and formal economic analysis to evaluate everyday economic and social phenomenons (S)
* Appraise the effects and merits of major public policies using economic tools (S)

*Achieved through reading and reflections, class discussions, assignments, and exams*	

**Communication**: Communicate knowledge, thoughts and reasoning clearly and effectively.
* Propose and formulate economic arguments verbally and in writing (S)

*Achieved through reading and reflections, class discussions, assignments, and exams*

## Grading
You will be evaluated with a total of 400 points, which consist of the following:

1. Thoughts and Questions (50 points, 12.5% of your grade)   
At the start of each week, you should read and reflect on the relevant book chapter(s), and answer the following question:   
`What did you find most challenging, confusing, or noteworthy about the reading?`
	- You get 5 points for each TQ you submit as long as it is a good-faith effort. 
	- Each TQ is due by 10 pm on the day before we start a new chapter. 
	- I will drop the lowest two TQ scores.
2. In-class Exercises (50 points, 12.5% of your grade)   
We will be solving most in-class exercises together. Gradings are based on correctness, but you should be able to get the correct answer with active participation in class.
	- You get a maximum 5 points for each in-class exercise you submit.
	- Each in-class exercise is due in a week on the day it is issued, though you are strongly encouraged to complete it **in class**.
	- I will drop the lowest two in-class exercise grades

3. Problem Sets (80 points, 20% of your grade)	
	- There will be 5 assignments throughout the semester. 
	- The lowest grade from the assignments will be dropped.
	- You will have one week to complete each assignment. Late assignments are accepted, though it reduces your grade by 10% each day. 
	- All assignments are individual unless otherwise stated. 
	
4. Exams (220 points, 55% of your grade)
	- Two midterm exam and a final exam assignment will be given throughout the semester. Each worth 110 points.
	- The lowerest one of the four grades will be dropped.
	- Should you miss any of the exams, that exam score is simply dropped regardless of reason. Make-up exams are not given due to temporary illness.
	- University athletes, students participating in official university sponsored events, and students with documentation from the Dean of Students Office may be given a make-up exam pending ample written notification in advance (at least 7 days prior to a scheduled exam). Documentation is required.

As a student at the University of Florida, you have committed yourself to uphold the Honor Code, which includes the following pledge: We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honesty and integrity. You are expected to exhibit behavior consistent with this commitment to the UF academic community, and on all work submitted for credit at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment." It is assumed that you will complete all work independently in each course unless the instructor provides explicit permission for you to collaborate on course tasks (e.g. assignments, papers, quizzes, exams). Furthermore, as part of your obligation to uphold the Honor Code, you should report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. It is your individual responsibility to know and comply with all university policies and procedures regarding academic integrity and the Student Honor Code. Violations of the Honor Code at the University of Florida will not be tolerated. Violations will be reported to the Dean of Students Office for consideration of disciplinary action. For more information regarding the Student Honor Code, please see: https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/process/student-conduct-code/


#### Plagiarism:
The Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code states that: "A Student must not represent as the Student's own work all or any portion of the work of another." Plagiarism includes but is not limited to:    

*	Stealing, misquoting, insufficiently paraphrasing, or patch-writing.
*	Self-plagiarism, which is the reuse of the Student's own submitted work, or the simultaneous submission of the Student's own work, without the full and clear acknowledgment and permission of the Faculty to whom it is submitted.
*	Submitting materials from any source without proper attribution.
*	Submitting a document, assignment, or material that, in whole or in part, is identical or substantially identical to a document or assignment the Student did not author."

#### COVID-19 University Policy:

All other purposes are prohibited.  Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.   
 
A class lecture is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.   
 
Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited. To publish means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. 

#### University Honesty Policy

#### Software Use
All faculty, staff, and students of the University are required and expected to obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use.  Failure to do so can lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the individual violator.

#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion:

The University of Florida's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) supports the University of Florida's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. By fostering a sense of belonging for students, staff, and faculty, while leveraging the uniqueness of the people who study and work at the university, we believe our campus community is enriched and enhanced by diversity, including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexuality, class, and religion. This course will support an understanding of the diversity of our distance and campus communities as well as our agricultural and natural resource communities, locally and globally. 

This course will strive to create a learning environment for students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences while honoring your identities. In this class we will take the following approaches to help achieve this:    

*	All course participants will use the names and pronouns provided by students for use in class. If these differ from those that appear in official university records, you can change your Display Name at One.UF.
*	If your performance in this course is being impacted by your experiences inside and/or outside the classroom, do not hesitate to contact the instructor and/or teaching assistant (TA). Instructors in CALS are a great resource for you and you may provide feedback anonymously.  Feedback may result in general announcements to the class, if necessary, or reporting to appropriate UF personnel to address your concerns. 
*	CALS instructors and TAs, like many people, are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that makes you feel uncomfortable, please discuss with your instructor or TA or contact the CALS Dean's Office (cals-dean@ufl.edu).
