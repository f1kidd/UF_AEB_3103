## What is economics?

Here I have a list of questions, and I want you to think about: do you think this is economics?

* What causes the business cycle (bubble and recession)?
* How human heart works?
* How fast do people drive on the I-75 highway?

## Are these economics?
* How much should bitcoin be worth?
* What causes an earthquake?
* How much do people eat at a buffet?

## Are these economics?
* Why are some countries rich and others poor?
* Should we ban off-shoring drilling?
* How many children should a family have?

## Are these economics?
* Who profits when gas price at the pump goes up? 
* Sentencing every drug dealer to life without parole can end the opioid crisis.
* Should the Gators play a 4th down and 3 at the 50 yard line?

## What does economics study?
* Economics studies how humans make decisions **under various incentives and constraints**
  - How much to each at a buffet?
  - How do you decide how fast to drive on the I-75?


## How fast to drive on the I-75?

* Fuel costs (driving faster costs more fuel)
* The (opportunity) cost of time
* The (small) possibility of getting busted by the police if you speed
  - And all the trouble after that
* The (even smaller) possibility of a car crash
  - Driving faster = More deadly crash
  
## How much to each at a buffet? 

* The cost of getting into the buffet
* The enjoyment one gets from consuming food

## What does economics study?
* Economics studies how humans make decisions **under various incentives and constraints**
* How these human decisions shape markets and societal outcomes
  - Who profits when gas price at the pump goes up?

## What does economics study?
* How humans make decisions **under various incentives and constraints**
* How these human decisions shape markets and the society collectively
* What are the effects of markets and/or governmental policies
  - Can sentencing every drug dealer to life without parole end the opioid crisis?
  
## Can sentencing every drug dealer to life without parole end the opioid crisis?

* For the drug dealers, they trade-off the reward (profits from dealing) with 1) the risk of getting caught; and 2) the penalty if getting caught
* Increasing sentencing makes drug dealing more risky
* They will ask higher risk-premium (i.e., rewards)
* "Market" prices for drugs become higher
* Does a higher drug price lower drug consumption?

## What does economics study?
* How humans make decisions **under various incentives and constraints**
* How these human decisions shape markets and the society collectively
* What are the effects of markets and/or governmental policies
* How does "the economy" work
  - What cause booms and busts?
